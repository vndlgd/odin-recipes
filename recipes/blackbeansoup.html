    <p class="description">Easy-to-make, comforting black bean soup made with simple ingredients in 1 pot! A 30-minute
        meal or side that’s
        customizable and incredibly satisfying.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 Tbsp oil (or sub water)</li>
        <li>1 cup diced white or yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp each sea salt + black pepper (more to taste // depends on saltiness of broth)</li>
        <li>2 15-ounce cans black beans* (slightly drained)</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth (or store bought)</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin (for smokiness)</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (optional // for heat)</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp chopped vegan dark chocolate (for depth of flavor // we like Theo Dark Chocolate Sea Salt // or sub
            with 1 Tbsp cacao powder)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water), onion, and garlic. Season with a pinch each
            salt and pepper and sauté for 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add black beans, vegetable broth, cumin, chili powder, coriander, chipotle peppers (optional – start with
            the lesser amount and work up // adjust to preferred heat level), dark chocolate, and remaining salt and
            pepper (a couple healthy pinches each).</li>
        <li>Bring back to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for about 15-20 minutes
            (the longer it simmers, the more the flavors develop).</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding chipotle peppers for spice, chocolate for depth of flavor, cumin
            or chili powder for smokiness, or more salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Enjoy as is, or pair with cooked grains such as rice or quinoa. Topping options include fresh lime, avocado
            or guacamole, cilantro, onion, hot sauce, and/or salsa!</li>
        <li>Store soup well covered in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days. Will keep in the freezer for 1 month (oftentimes
            longer).</li>
    </ol>
